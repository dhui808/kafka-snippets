### Messaging system use cases - ChatGPT
  Asynchronous Communication: Messaging systems enable asynchronous communication between different parts of an application, 
  allowing them to operate independently and continue processing without waiting for a response.
  
  Decoupling Microservices: By using a messaging system, microservices can communicate without being tightly coupled. 
  This decoupling improves scalability and makes it easier to update or replace services without affecting the entire system.
